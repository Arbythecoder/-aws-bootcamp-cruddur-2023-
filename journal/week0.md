###Install AWS CLI

I was not able able to use Gitpod and i didnt try out the Github codespace due to the fact that i cant navigate through properly yet,so i used my local environment.

To prove i am able to use the AWS CLI.
Here is the installation instructions i used for my configuration of my local machine on windows.

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI.

I installed the AWS CLI via command in **Command Prompt**:

```
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
```
proof of the AWS CLI installation are below:
